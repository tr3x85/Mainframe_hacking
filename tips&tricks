Passwords on z/OS are usually stored in the RACF database in a hashed format, by default stored using the DES algorithm (limited to 56 bitsâ€™ entropy) with weak password policies (no mixed characters, 3 special characters, etc.)
RACF handles every authentication and control access issued on z/OS.
Filenames on z/OS follow a DNS-like naming convention: a succession of qualifiers separated by dots. (e.g. SYS2.RACFDS)
APF libraries can request the highest privileges and perform any action on the system (authorised mode)
A typical mainframe can easily have thousands of users. We will therefore only target users with interesting attributes:
  - OPERATIONS: assigned to users or service accounts to access any data regardless of the security rules in place
  - PROTECTED: usually assigned to service accounts (databases, middlewares, etc.) to restrict their ability to open interactive sessions
Customer Information Control System (CICS) is a middleware used to host interactive applications on a Mainframe
